### Resources Utilized:
* [RyiSnow's Java Gamemaking Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq) (This was a fantastic resource for learning how to build a game from scratch)
* [Sebastian Lague - A* Pathfinding Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cq5Umv3pMC9SPnKjfp9eGW) (Lague's videos do a great job at explaining the A* pathfinding algorithm and they helped me understand how this works in code)
