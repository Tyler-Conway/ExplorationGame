### Instructions:
  * To open normal doors: go up to the door and press ENTER.
  * Use WASD to navigate your inventory.
  * To open colorful doors: go up to the door, open your inventory, and press ENTER on the key that matches the door's color.
  * To parry a monster's attacks: press SPACE just before they attack. You will knock them back and can do **extra damage** following a parry.
  * To equip a different weapon or shield: open your inventory and press ENTER on the weapon/shield you want to equip.
  * Equip the lantern to light up your surroundings at night.
  * To sleep through the night, select the Tent item from your inventory.
  * Trade with the traders located in cabins throughout the world. The Blue Trader is in World01, the Red Trader is in World02, and the Yellow Trader is in Beach02.
  * The peasant class is like the wretch/deprived class from Elden Ring/Dark Souls: it's a weak character class.
  * To push the boulders onto the metal plates in the dungeon puzzle, just walk into them.
  * If you get one of the boulders stuck in the dungeon puzzle, leave the dungeon and come back to reset boulder positions.
  * To avoid **potential audio issues** that may crash the game, I recommend playing this game on Windows or MacOS.
  * You can see more about this project on my [personal website repository](https://github.com/Tyler-Conway/Personal-Website). (once/if I make it public).

### Secrets/Debugging Features:
  * press ENTER on the right side of the World01 pool to level up quickly. =)
  * press T to turn on Debug Mode, which turns off collisions, resets objects, and lets you see your world position and frame times in nanoseconds.
  * you can bypass the TriColorDoor to access the end game area without the TriColorKey if you are in Debug Mode and you press ENTER on the TriColorDoor.
